<h1>MidnightFocus README</h1>

This is a GitHub repository containing all of the code I needed to create MidnightFocus, a spinoff of Nicholas Renotte's ML Drowsiness Detection App (of course, with my own tastes).

You'll find here my Jupyter Notebook that I used to set up and train my model (using images labelled manually with LabelImg, not included here), the weights that I ended up using, the sounds and pop-up image that I use in the app, and finally the app python file itself.

It is only necessary to run the app file itself to launch the window, adjusting for changes in the folder path in the file if necessary.

Have fun!
